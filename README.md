# My Project Portfolio

## 1. [App Store Project](https://github.com/musicmaster81/App_Store_Project/blob/main/App%20Store%20Project.py)
#### This project analyzes apps on both the Google Playstore and the App Store. The analysis looks at the following features of apps on each respective appstore:
- The number of free apps on either store
- The most popular genres of apps
- The most popular apps based on installations or downloads

### The idea behind this project is, if I were approached by employers who were considering launching an app, what insights could I provide? 

## 2. [Hacker News Posts Project](https://github.com/musicmaster81/Hacker_News_Project/blob/main/Hacker%20News%20Post%20Project.py)
#### For this project, we examine the posts from a popular technology news website called [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). There are two different types of posts that users can submit to the Hacker News website, "Ask HN" and "Show HN". The former posts are used to ask a question, whereas the latter are used to impart content that users find interesting or insightful. We seek to answer two questions in this analysis:
- Which type of posts, on average, receive more comments?
- Do posts created at a certain time have an above average amount of comments?

### With the importance of Social Media in our society, insights like these can be invaluable to marketing teams for companies looking to improve the amount of interatcion between the company and potential consumers. 

## 3. [Legacy Automation Project](https://github.com/musicmaster81/Legacy_Automation_Project)
#### This project is one that I created to assist me with a daily report that I run each day for work. I was able to automate a 40 minute process and condense it down to 2 minutes. Please note that the workflow will appear somewhat vague as I would rather not disclose any remotely sensitive information. While I try to describe the flow via comments as best I can in the source code, here is a brief summary of what is required by this process each day:
- Save a set of emails that contain data for that particular day
- Edit an excel file to update the date
- Update quntiessential workbooks with the most recent data
- Run previously constructed VBA macros to generate pdf's
- Update links in another pivotal workbook to reflect accurate days
- Run a batch file that uploads required documents to the cloud

### To reiterate, this is an example of what I have been able to accomplish using my skills as an aspiring Data Scientist to bring value to my organization by saving roughly 158hrs of work each year. 

## 4. [Traffic Analysis for I-94](https://github.com/musicmaster81/Traffic_Indicators_Project/blob/main/Traffic%20Indicators%20Project.py)
#### For this project, we wish to analyze traffic volume for a section of the I-94 expressway in Minnesota between Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Some of the questions that we wish to answer are:
- Is there a time of day where traffic volume is the most heavy?
- Is there a difference in travel patterns on weekends as opposed to weekdays?
- Do certain types of weather have an impact on traffic volume?

### With the amount of travel only increasing after the pandemic, perhaps a company like Uber or Door Dash would like to know precisely when traffic will be bad so they can prepare or avoid these above average travel times. 

## 5. [Euro vs. the USD Analysis](https://github.com/musicmaster81/EURO_vs_USD_Project/blob/main/Exchange%20Rates%20Project.py)
#### No project on my portfolio is probably more relevant than this one. For all of 2022, the Federal Reserve's FOMC has been hiking interest rates in an attempt to curb inflation that is boarderline run-away. This project takes a look at the value of the Euro compared to the USD to see examine the following:
- Did the slashing of interest rates during the 2008 Recession strengthen or weaken the Euro compared to the USD?
- Did the slashing of interest rates during the 2020 Pandemic strengthen or weaken the Euro compared to the USD?

### My hypothesis is that since hiking rates generally strengthens a currency, we should expect to see the slasing of rates weaken a currency. This project is also mainly meant to showcase my matplotlib graph construction skills. Here is the image that I created to validate my hypothesis:
