## [App Store Project](https://github.com/musicmaster81/App_Store_Project/blob/main/App%20Store%20Project.py)
#### This project analyzes apps on both the Google Playstore and the App Store. The analysis looks at the following features of apps on each respective appstore:
- The price of apps on each respective platform
- The most popular genres of apps
- The most popular apps based on user ratings
### The idea behind this project is, if I were approached by employers who were considering launching an app, what insights could I provide?
