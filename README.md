# The Portfolio of Daniel J. Garcia
## 1. [App Store Project](https://github.com/musicmaster81/App_Store_Project/blob/main/App%20Store%20Project.py)
#### This project analyzes apps on both the Google Playstore and the App Store. The analysis looks at the following features of apps on each respective appstore:
- The number of free apps on either store
- The most popular genres of apps
- The most popular apps based on installations or downloads

### The idea behind this project is, if I were approached by employers who were considering launching an app, what insights could I provide? 


## 2. [Hacker News Posts Project](https://github.com/musicmaster81/Hacker_News_Project/blob/main/Hacker%20News%20Post%20Project.py)
#### For this project, we examine the posts from a popular technology news website called [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). There are two different types of posts that users can submit to the Hacker News website, "Ask HN" and "Show HN". The former posts are used to ask a question, whereas the latter are used to impart content that users find interesting or insightful. We seek to answer two questions in this analysis:
- Which type of posts, on average, receive more comments?
- Do posts created at a certain time have an above average amount of comments?

### With the importance of Social Media in our society, insights like these can be invaluable to marketing teams for companies looking to improve the amount of interatcion between the company and potential consumers. 

## 3. [Legacy Automation Project]()
#### This project is one that I created to assist me with a daily report that I run each day for work. It is arguably the project that I am most proud of here, seeing as how I was able to automate a 40 minute project to only take 2 min. Please note that the workflow will appear somewhat vague as I cannot disclose any information deemed sensitive. While I try to describe the flow via comments as best I can in the source code, here is a brief summary of what is required by this report each day:
- Save a set of emails that contain data for that particular day
- Edit an excel file to update the date
- Update quntiessential workbooks with the most recent data
- Run previously constructed VBA macros to generate pdf's
- Update links in another pivotal workbook to reflect accurate days
- Run a batch file that uploads required documents to the cloud
### To reiterate, this is an example of what I have been able to accomplish using my skills as an aspiring Data Scientist to bring value to my organization by saving roughly 100hrs of work each year.
