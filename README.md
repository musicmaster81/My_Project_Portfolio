## [App Store Project](https://github.com/musicmaster81/App_Store_Project/blob/main/App%20Store%20Project.py)
#### This project analyzes apps on both the Google Playstore and the App Store. The analysis looks at the following features of apps on each respective appstore:
- The number of free apps on either store
- The most popular genres of apps
- The most popular apps based on installations or downloads

### The idea behind this project is, if I were approached by employers who were considering launching an app, what insights could I provide? 


## [Hacker News Posts Project](https://github.com/musicmaster81/Hacker_News_Project/blob/main/Hacker%20News%20Post%20Project.py)
### For this project, we examine the posts from a popular technology news website called [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). There are two different types of posts that users can submit to the Hacker News website, "Ask HN" and "Show HN". The former posts are used to ask a question, whereas the latter are used to impart content that users find interesting or insightful. We seek to answer two questions in this analysis:
- Which type of posts, on average, receive more comments?
- Do posts created at a certain time have an above average amount of comments?

### With the importance of Social Media in our society, insights like these can be invaluable to marketing teams for companies looking to improve the amount of interatcion between the company and potential consumers.
